- Proposed a relaxation step in Remez Exchange Algorithm, search the equioscillation points of error derivative more robustly. Applicable to arbitrary interval length and handle non-smooth functions.
- Shared same precision with MATLAB toolbox for low-degrees (2nd order), extendable to up to 33rd with better error guarantees of $10^{-14}$.
